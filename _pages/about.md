I recently graduated my Master's in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence from the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/human-centered-artificial-intelligence) where I also obtained my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data. I spent one semester abroad as an exchange student at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). 

I have a strong background in machine learning and my Master's Thesis focused on leveraging concepts from differential geometry in optimization for improving generalization performance.

I'm particularly interested in the theoretical aspects of machine learning and deep learning. Currently, I'm focusing on gaining further knowledge on:
- differental geometry in machine learning
- approximate Bayesian inference
- deep learning theory
