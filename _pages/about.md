I am a PhD student at the [Technical University of Denmark (DTU)](https://www.dtu.dk/english), supervised by [Georgios Arvanitidis](https://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~gear/) from  the [Section for Cognitive Systems](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/sections/cogsys). My project seeks to advance approximate Bayesian inference methods by leveraging concepts from differential geometry.

I have a strong background in machine learning and hold a Master's degree in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence with the thesis focusing on leveraging concepts from differential geometry in optimization for improving generalization performance.

I'm particularly interested in the theoretical aspects of machine learning and deep learning. Currently, I'm focusing on gaining further knowledge on:
- differental geometry in machine learning
- approximate Bayesian inference
- deep learning theory

<!-- I hold a Master's in Human-Centered AI and a Bachelor's degree in AI and Data Science from DTU. During my studies I visited [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) as an exchange student.  -->
